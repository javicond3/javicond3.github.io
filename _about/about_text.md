I participate in <span class="marked">European projects</span> focused in themes about digitalization such as <a href='http://yoda.dit.upm.es/' target='_blank'>YODA</a> (Your Open Data) or <a href='https://www.fci3.es/arportwin/' target='_blank'>A/RPORTWIN</a>. Moreover I colaborate with <a href='https://www.fiware.org/' target='_blank'>FIWARE</a>, developing processors for Draco Generic Enabler and I particiapte in some FIWARE Smart Data Model definitions.

 I studied <span class="marked">Telecommunications Engineering</span> at <a href='https://www.etsit.upm.es/' target='_blank'>ETSIT-UPM</a> where I graduated as the first in the specialty of Telematics in the Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications Technology and Services Engineering and I coursed the Master's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering at the same university.

<br>

 Since the last year of the degree and throughout the master I have combined my studies with the collaboration in the <span class="marked">GID</span> (Grupo de Integración Digital) of the <a href='https://www.etsit.upm.es/' target='_blank'>ETSIT-UPM</a>. In the group I have carried out design solutions and full-stack development tasks focused on the digitalization of administrative and teaching processes at ETSIT. I am the main developer of <span class='marked'>ProgDoc</span>, the service with which the teaching planning of all the degrees at ETSIT has been taught since 2018. Currently, I continue to collaborate with the group carrying out project management and solution design tasks.

 I am <span class="marked">interested</span> in software development, data science, digitalization, and DevOps. I took numerous courses through online platforms  that have allowed me to acquire new skills in these fields.
