 I am a <span class="marked">predoctoral researcher</span> within the <a href='http://ging.github.io/' target='_blank'>GING</a> (Grupo de Internet de Nueva Generación) of the <a href='https://www.upm.es/' target='_blank'>UPM</a> (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. My research interests lie in the fields of Open Linked Data, Digital Twins, Big Data and Machine Learning.

Moreover I colaborate with <a href='https://www.fiware.org/' target='_blank'>FIWARE</a>, developing processor for the Draco GE and models for FIWARE Smart Data Models. In turn, I carry out teaching activities, such as the direction of final degree projects.

 I studied <span class="marked">Telecommunications Engineering</span> at <a href='https://www.etsit.upm.es/' target='_blank'>ETSIT-UPM</a> where I graduated as the first in the specialty of Telematics in the Degree in Telecommunications Technology and Services Engineering and a Master's in Telecommunications Engineering.

In the group I have carried out solutions design and full-stack development tasks focused on the digitization of administrative and teaching processes at ETSIT. Participate in the creation of <span class='marked'>ProgDoc</span>, the service with which the teaching planning of all the degrees taught at ETSIT since 2018 is being carried out. Currently I continue to collaborate with the group carrying out Project Management and Solution Design tasks.

 I am <span class="marked">interested</span> in software development, data science, digitization, and DevOps. I took numerous courses through online platforms  that have allowed me to acquire new skills in these fields.
