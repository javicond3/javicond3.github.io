In the group I carried out design solutions and full-stack development tasks focused on the digitalization of administrative and teaching processes at <a href='https://www.etsit.upm.es/' target='_blank'>ETSIT-UPM</a>. I am the main developer of <span class='marked'>ProgDoc</span>, the service with which the teaching planning of all the degrees at ETSIT has been taught since 2018. I am also the main developer of **Gestión Títulos**, a system used for digitalizing the process of requesting official documents. I also acted as the manager of other projects as **miHorario** or **Gestión de Trámites** tools used for managing the teachers' and students' schedulers and for digitalizing university process respectively.
