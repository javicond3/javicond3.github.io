I am coursing my PhD in the <a href='https://www.upm.es/' target='_blank'>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid</a>.

My research interests rely on the fields of Open Linked Data, Digital Twins, Big Data and Machine Learning.

Me and my collegues have published papers related to Digital Twins, Context Aware-Systems, and experiments of using Open-Source initiatives for reducing the gap between the Industry and the Academia. Within this contributions we propose reference architectures for developing smart solutions, combined with use cases that validate the performance of our proposals.
